# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description
This project aims to inform the user about the users who are likely to churn by using two different methods, random forest and logistic regression.

## Files and data description
- /data/bank_data.csv: The data the program gets the credit card information.
- /images/eda: Exploratory data analysis results.
- /images/results: Results from the trained random forest classifier and logistic regression models.
 - /logs/: log's from the training of the models.
 - /models/: Saved images of the trained random forest and logistic regression models.

## Running Files
Program relies on two Python files, churn_library.py and churn_script_logging_and_tests.py. 

First one gets credit card data and trains random forest and linear regression models and returns which categories are most likely to churn.

Second one is for testing the functions in churn_library.py. It tests and logs the each functions status under logs folder so that user can check if the program runs succesfully.
